## Abstract
This workshop is designed to enrich the educational journey of first-year engineering faculty members by providing a comprehensive, hands-on experience that bridges the gap between theoretical control concepts and their practical applications. The primary objective is to demonstrate the relevance of control theory in modern engineering through the use of a robotic arm for task planning. Robotic arms, crucial in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare, for precision tasks like assembling electronic components and performing minimally invasive surgeries, demonstrate the importance of advanced control systems.  Participants will be introduced to key theoretical equations and control concepts, laying a foundational understanding essential for the progression from theory to practice.
 
The workshop includes an exercise that guides attendees through the process of translating control theory into a tangible simulation using Simulink. This step is crucial for visualizing and tweaking control strategies in a controlled environment before applying them to real-world scenarios. The culmination of the workshop is an exercise focused on the actual implementation of these simulations on a Quanser robotic arm, providing a hands-on experience that solidifies the learned concepts. By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained valuable insights into the seamless integration of theoretical knowledge and practical application, empowering them to incorporate these methodologies into their teaching and research endeavors.
